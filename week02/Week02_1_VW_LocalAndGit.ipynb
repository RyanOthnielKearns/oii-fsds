    "# The Terminal \n",
    "\n",
    "We have thus far used the terminal and made some assumptions with your familiarity. Yet, it is worth taking a moment to have a dedicated look to command line interfaces. Much work will be done with CLIs, even if modern systems have excellent affordances for developing code and presenting results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main command line interface on Mac is the Terminal. On Windows it's the shell, or typically in use \"PowerShell\". The commands for Terminal and Powershell are somewhat similar but there are subtle differences that are PowerShell-specific. I mention PowerShell-specific, because Mac's app is the Terminal, but the terminal itself is really just a window to a CLI, and that CLI is probably called `bash` or `zsh` depending on your version of Mac. When one is interacting with a remote computer in some way they are often also interfacing with a `bash` or sometimes a `zsh` CLI. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this couse we will show how to connect to a remote server next week. This will be done with Visual Studio but also with a terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key concepts with a terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal has a 'state'. That is to say it starts with a specific location and set of possible commands. These commands come from the shell, so `zsh` might have slightly different conventions from `bash` but generally they have similar commands. The old `DOS` prompt on windows, which you can still access by typing `cmd` into the search pane on windows can bring up a 'Command Prompt'. There the commands can be different, but generally the same commands work on PowerShell as they do on a mac Terminal app. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the app it will present a 'command prompt' which is a visual signifier of the state of the terminal. It will typically show key details like: `username@hostname:current_directory$`. Here, `username` is the name of the logged-in user, `hostname` is the name of the computer, and `current_directory` represents the path to the current working directory. There are, however, ways to format this prompt to make it shorter or display different details. The cursor then starts from this prompt and one can type commands. These commands are understood by the shell as coming from this specific `current_directory`. Thus, we can discover which directory we are working in with `pwd` or \"present working directory\". On DOS it would be `cwd`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can list the contents of the directory, make a subdirectory or even open this directory in an explorer window. Try the following: \n",
    "- `ls`: Lists a directory's contents. Try the following arguments to see a difference: `ls -a`, `ls -l`. The second one is useful because it shows size and _permissions_. We will cover permissions later. \n",
    "- `mkdir temp`: This will make a directory in this folder called \"temp\". \n",
    "- `cd temp`: This will now change the prompt location to be inside that temp directory. \n",
    "- `touch tempfile`: This will create an empty file in the computer in the temp directory.\n",
    "- `cd ..`: This will change directory to the parent folder. \n",
    "- `rm temp`: This will _may_ delete the folder, but not this time, since there is a file inside. To force it to delete the folder and its contents we would write `rm -r temp`. Try that and clean up the newly made folder. The `-r` refers to 'recursive', which loosely means follow all the links. We will cover recursion below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's repeat this, but this time, but instead of `touch`, let's edit a file in there. The terminal has a couple baked-in text editors. The most complex of these is probably `vi` / `vim`. This stands for 'Virtual Interface (modern)'. `vim` is basically the same but has some nice syntax highlighting. Often modern shells will just redirect `vi` to `vim`. So where it says `touch tempfile`, this time write `vi tempfile`. You will now have an entirely new interface and it will be a bit tricky to leave this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief departure into `vim`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you first open vi you might be temped to start typing immediately, but this will not work as expected. You are in a 'modal interface'. It has different modes. The initial model is the 'command mode', so here you would type a command. One command would be to insert text into the file. So if you type `i` then watch the interface change and then you can start typing. But when you are done, how do you get back to the command line? A CLI does not assume access to a mouse or trackpad. So it does not have the same visual affordances for pointing. Rather, it uses visual affordances for states. We have changed our CLI state into `--insert--` within `vi`. Let's change back to the command mode: press escape. Observe it has changed state and `--insert--` has disappeared. If you type `:q` you will be asking to quit. But it might remind that you have not saved the file. If you type `:wq` then it will write and quit. `vi` is very deep and can be used with great skill for many old school programmers, but it is often intimidating and not really the easiest when you simply want to edit a fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nano instead\n",
    "Typically shells will also have access to a more straightforward editor. Here are a couple: `nano` and `pico`. Depending on your OS, one may be available. Generally one can type `nano` and it will direct accordingly. This editor generally just has the single editing pane. Instead of a separate command state, it uses the control key to bind to basic operations. So you would type as one command `ctrl-x` to exit and `ctrl-w` to save. If you type `nano somefile.txt` it will edit that file even if it hasn't been created. But if you type just `nano` then it will ask for the name of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Help files on a terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful reason to introduce vim is that it is very similar to the set of state operations that the terminal uses to display help files. In the terminal, help is often included as a manual for a specific command, thus one would write `man nano` or `man cd` to bring up the manual for that command. But this will be another state, like `vi`. To scroll one can use the space to go down (or `shift-space` to go up). But at the end is not a cursor. One did not append the `man` file to the prompt. To return to the prompt state one can type q at any point (notice that there is already a `:` at the bottom waiting for a command unlike `vi`).  \n",

    "Python and R are both ultimately kernels for performing operations. When we run a program in Python, either in VS or in the command line, we are sending these instructions to a kernel. Python kernels take text based instructions and compile them right then and run the compiled program. This is often why Python is called a scripting language. `bash` is also a scripting language such that we can chain commands like `cd` and `mkdir` together into a script, as well as do things like send information to a file or to standard out. Below is a simple shell script that will create two files, make a directory, and write those files to the directory. \n",

The file itself is very readable, and was produced by Claude, (see AI declaration below). It includes variables and the use of the `echo` command, which is useful command for sending text. You can use `echo` directly in the terminal to print out some text. But in this case, it uses echo and redirects the text using `> <filepath>` and `>> <filepath>` (overwrite and append, equivalent to python's `fileout.open(<filepath>, 'w')` and `..., 'a')` specifcally).\n",

    "The file `make_tempfiles.py` does the same thing as `make_tempfiles.sh` but does it in Python. You can view the two of them to see the differences or commonalities. The Python script uses the `os` library which is a generally low level but interoperable library for writing files and performing operations on the operating system. While bash scripts would run with `./<filename>` a Python file runs with `python <filename>`. Of course, you can run a Python file from within a bash script if you write `python <filename>` inside the bash script. Similarly, you can run all sorts of commands in such a script, like `pip`. Thus, one might run a script to install a series of components and set up one's environment for coding. \n",

This should be written as an action as if saying what these changes will do to the existing repo. So we wouldn't say \"I'm just practicing opening the file\", but perhaps \"include local user practice on the file\" or \"include results from files ran locally\". However, committing changes does not automatically synchronise those changes to the server. To do that we would `push` the changes to the server. This can be accomplished either from the sidebar source control pane or in the terminal. In the directory with .git we would type `git push` and the changes should be pushed to the server. If someone else had created changes since we last looked at the repo, we can bring those changes to our local version using `git pull`.

    "In today's lab you will be asked to fork and then clone a GitHub repository. This repository contains a number of files that make it look like a reasonable GitHub repo. It includes `requirements.txt`, a `readme.md`, and some files for you to use. This repo will download a Wikipedia page using Python. Then it parses the resulting XML in such a way that it creates folders for each year and month. Your task will be to alter the Python script in two ways: \n",
    "- 1. Edit the Python script so that there is a count_files() method available. Write a print statement that indicates how many files are available for this article. Then run the script again.\n",
    "- 2. Create a condition called 'update'. This should be an argument to the Python file, such that one can write `python xx.py =\"article name\" update=False`. The default state will be `True`. When false, the program will only count the files, but it will not download a new XML and try to create a new folder or set of folders. That way, it will always return the number of files if there is a directory named `\"article name\", but it will not download and process a new version of the file from WikiMedia unless update=True. \n",
    "- 3. Commit and push your changes to your repo. Write an appropriate comment. \n",

    "- We will be learning about argument strings and APIs.\n",
    "- We will be altering argument strings to get a complete snapshot of a specific page without asking for unnecessary details. \n",
    "- We will be using the wikipedia API so that we are not simply getting edits of the page but useful metadata about pageviews. \n",
    "- We will construct a DataFrame from the Wikpedia pages, again using a recursive function to build rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using recursive functions rather than just one big data set? \n",
    "1. So that you can practice with an operation that is very common. \n",
    "2. So that we can store our data in files that are already somewhat processed \n",
    "  1. And that the processed files will not be in single humungous directories which can cause problems for operating systems (especially over 1k files). \n",
    "\n",
    "On Friday we will be looking at how to arrange data in a time series. The lab on Friday \n",
    "- Taking all the revisions and plotting them on a temporal axis. \n",
    "- Comparing edits across different time resolutions and between pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then on Monday you will have time to work as a group. We are requesting that you create a single repository which works as a report, to which everyone in the group could theoretically check in some edits. Upload your report to that repository.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your group will be responsible for answering the following: \n",
    "1. Compare and contrast the editing intensity of two public figures over the course of their Wikpedia pages. Highlight the editing intensity at different temporal resolutions to show a potential spike or peak related to a relevant time frame. \n",
    "2. Do a lexical comparison over time with the two figures. This should be a term or term(s) that can be found through simple lexical searching (including regex if warranted). Say something about the presence of this word over time. It could be the presence or absence, the times it was edited in/out, the count of this word in the article, as long as it is something we can search for in a string rather than something we would infer using some latent construct or model.

    "This time I will be a little more involved in my AI declaration and post the entirety of the chat. This is done using a javascript command that I entered into the browser console. The javascript will take the chat and then render it as markdown. It comes from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ryanschiang/claude-export . Here you can see my prompts, the code (wherever it was in text rather than artifact), and the explanations provided by Claude. You can also see how I used context to help guide the code, and that generally I already knew what I was looking for ahead of time. The responses from Claude were often verbose. Some of that verbosity is helpful but some of it is unnecessary or makes some assumptions about follow through that might not have been warranted. \n",

    "While I already had the notes for this lecture skectched out, I was surprised that Claude's answer to my first question aligned so clearly with my own learning goals for this class. This time I used Claude Opus 3.0 rather than Sonnet. It's text is sometimes a little more reasonable and it often does not make as verbose code as Sonnet. That said, it is easier to run out of tokens with Opus, and Opus is only available on a subscription. (Note: I then ran it and it gave an error, so this will be TBD unless there's an update). "
